# Spectacles-recommendation-system-based-on-faceshape
Recommending glasses based on face shape is the main objective of this project. The project works on an automatic shape extraction and classification method for face and eyeglass frame shapes. This application has been done by using Convolutional Neural Network, it will identify a suitable spectacle for the personâ€™s face shape and recommends best glasses for the recognized face shape.

# CNN Algorithm 
The common technique that is generally used for face recognition is Deep learning using convolutional neural networks (CNN).
## CNN models used here is to extract the face feature of the image using CNN layers.
